Here's a Calendar UI.
You can click on a particular date to mark it in blue color. A click anywhere will remove it.
On clicking the "+" sign, you will be navigated to create an event frame. You can turn on/off Repeat. You cannot edit an event , I'm still working on how to add that. On clicking on Save, you will be back on previous frame. 
If you click on November, a new frame will appear where you can choose a month to view its calendar, once.
Thanks for viewing my UI.
